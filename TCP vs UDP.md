# TCP vs UDP

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
"Reliable delivery, in order, with confirmation"

## How it works:
- Sends data
- Waits for confimation
- Resends if something went wrong
- Keep everything in order

## Features 
- Reliable
- Ordered (data arrivesin correct sequence)
- Slower than UDP due checks and error correction
- Connection based (must establish the connection first)

## Used for:
- Websites (HTTP/HTTPs)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP)
- File Downloads
- SSH (remote access)


## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
"Faster but not reliable"
 
## How it works:
- Sends data and forgets it
- No confimation
- No retry if lost
- No ordering

## Features
- Faster 
- Less reliable
- No connection setup

## Used for:
- Video streaming
- Video games
- Voice Calls (VoIP)
- DNS queries

# Easy to remember
- TCP = Trustworthy courier (slow but safe)
- UDP = Fast messanger (fast but may lose stuff)

## TCP matters because:
- Most services run on it (80, 443, 22, 445)
- You scan it with nmap
- You exploit web + system services through it

## UDP matters because:
- DNS often uses it (port 53)
- Some services hide there
- UDP scans are slower and less common but important
